          Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying 
          out print, graphic or web designs. The purpose of 
          lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text 
          (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.
          The passage experienced a surge in popularity when it was first
          used on dry-transfer sheets. The passage is attributed 
          to a typesetter back in nineteen ninety eight when the 
          undertaker threw mankind off h–µll in a cell, and plummeted 
          sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
